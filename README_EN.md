  - To set MAX performance for each emulator:
    - In the ROM selection screen, press SELECT and set `CPU SCALING GOVERNOR` to `PERFORMANCE` and `GPU PERFORMANCE PROFILE` to `BEST PERFORMANCE` in `ADVANCED SYSTEM OPTIONS`.
  - To set MAX performance for each ROM:
    - Highlight a ROM and press the X button, then set `CPU SCALING GOVERNOR` to `PERFORMANCE` and `GPU PERFORMANCE PROFILE` to `BEST PERFORMANCE` in `ADVANCED GAME OPTIONS`.
  - To set MAX performance for all emulators:
    - Press the Start button and set `DEFAULT SCALING GOVERNOR` to `PERFORMANCE` and `GPU PERFORMANCE PROFILE` to `BEST PERFORMANCE` in `SYSTEM SETTINGS`.
